Important and Acknowledgments

You can follow this steps if you want to build the SSTools4MC Installer from the source code by yourself. Please note that this is not mandatory. You can always download the latest version of the installer from the GitHub Releases page.

Clone this Repository
First, clone/download this repository:

git clone https://github.com/ngdplnk/SSTools4MC.git
Install NSIS
You need to install the latest NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) version to build the installer. You can download it from NSIS Official Website. Be sure to follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Verify Files
Navigate to the 3-launcher folder in the cloned repository and there select a release channel that you want to build the launcher for (continue in subdirectory 1-stable-channel for Stable channel or in subdirectory 2-dev-channel for Dev Channel). Ensure that you have the following files (there may be more, but you need to have at least these):

If you are building the launcher for the Stable channel:

build.nsi
icon.ico
launcher.pyw
If you are building the launcher for the Dev channel:

build-dev.nsi
icon-dev.ico
launcher-dev.pyw
If any of these files are missing, please download them directly from the repository.

You will use the main.py from the 1-stable folder if you are building the Stable Channel Launcher, or the dev.py file from the 2-dev folder as your bundled version in the launcher you are building.

Edit .nsi File
Open the build.nsi or build-dev.nsi file in a text editor and replace the placeholders <TYPE THE XXXX PATH HERE> with the actual paths to your files, respectively. Save the changes.

Compile the Installer
Open NSIS.
Select the option "Compile NSI Scripts".
Drag and drop the file you just edited into the NSIS window.
An installer for your desired SSTools4MC release channel will be created.
Enjoy!
